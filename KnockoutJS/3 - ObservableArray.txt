1) Observable Arrays

- If you want to detect and respond to changes of a collection of things, use an observableArray

- this is useful in many scenarios where you’re displaying or editing multiple values and need repeated sections of UI to appear and disappear as items are added and removed.

- key point: An observableArray tracks which objects are in the array, not the state of those objects
- An observableArray just tracks which objects it holds, and notifies listeners when objects are added or removed
