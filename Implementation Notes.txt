- Copy static files to dist
- Sass to CSS
- Introducing Browserify
- Starting up a development server
- Adding basic automation
- Error handling
- Make it smoother with BrowserSync

- add faviicon???
- use IIFE to add click event handler to markers (so that info window displays details on location)
- think of how to integrate KO into the whole thing; start with view model creation
- implement list view 
- implement search bar
- look at other projects to understand how professionals structure their app
- what are my build steps for this projects


// TODO
