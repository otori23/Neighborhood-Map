7) Progress so far

- JS objects from places API is the "data" for the viewmodel
- how to turn this effciently into KO view model (manually or mapping pluggin)?
- add faviicon???
- use IIFE to add click event handler to markers (so that info window displays details on location)
- think of how to integrate KO into the whole thing; start with view model creation
- implement list view 
- implement search bar
- look at other projects to understand how professionals structure their app
- what are my build steps for this projects


// TODO

- Bower ???
- Browserify ???
- RequireJS ??? (e.g. for AMD)
- underscore ???
- CSS

1) CSS

a) Always remember to CSS Reset

- the styles basically remove all margins, padding, and font size from the most common block-level elements
- the reset styles eliminate many of the cross-browser display problems you’ll encounter related to these properties
- at a bare minimum, you should always include this set of styles in every style sheet you create
- probably the most important properties are the margin and padding settings in the first style
- there’s enough cross-browser weirdness related to those two properties that you should always zero these out and start fresh

b) Floating list-view like Side-bar note for Tutorial 7

- Chapter 7 tutorial: will want the list-view of places to be positioned like the note in this chapter's tutorial
- floating with box-shadow and some type of margin spacing it from browser's edge

c) Setting Width of List View in tutorial for chapter 6

- see how the list is styled (width + float) in tutorial for Chapter 6

d) Chapter 9 - Vertical List based Nav construction is similar to needed list view

What are Favicons?

Favicons are small 16x16 icon files that are displayed next to the URL of your site in a browser's address bar. Additionally they're often displayed next to the name of your site in a user's list of open tabs and bookmark listings making it easier for the user to quickly identify amongst other sites.

What are App Icons?

App Icons are the images you press on your smartphone to launch an application. As newer phones are released with higher resolution screens, higher resolution app icons are needed. Developers still want to maintain support for the older phones with lower resoltion so when you create an app icon you need to create several size variations of the same image. This is true for all smartphones like the iPhone and Android, and even tablets like iPad.

What does this tool do?

Although many modern web browsers support favicons saved as GIFs, PNGs or other popular file formats all versions of Internet Explorer still require favicons to be saved as ICO files (a Microsoft icon format). This tool provides an easy way to convert any GIF, PNG or JPEG to ICO which is supported by all modern web browsers. It also enables you to create favicons from scratch via a handy online editor. Additionally the editor lets you manually tweak generated favicons to ensure the best possible result.

Using a favicon

After generating a favicon with this tool download and save to the root directory of your site. Then include the following code in the head of your HTML document.

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
