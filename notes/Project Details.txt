How will I complete this Project?

- Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
(https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989-nd)


- Download the Knockout framework.
(http://knockoutjs.com/)

- Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
(https://developers.google.com/maps/)

- Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.

- Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.

- Implement a list view of the identified locations.

- Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course(https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110-nd).
