Instructor Notes

Searching and Filtering

We expect your application to provide a search/filter option on the existing map markers that are already displayed. If a list of locations already shows up on a map, we expect your application to offer a search function that filters this existing list. The list view and the markers should update accordingly in real-time. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough to meet specifications.

What does "errors are handled gracefully" mean?

In case of error (e.g. in a situation where a third party api does not return the expected result) we expect your webpage to do one of the following:

A message shows up to notify the user that the data can't be loaded, OR There are no negative repercussions to the UI.

Note: Please note that we expect students to handle errors if the browser has trouble initially reaching the 3rd-party site as well. For example, imagine a user is using your neighborhood map, but her firewall prevents her from accessing the Instagram servers.

Why?

It is important to handle errors to give users a consistent and good experience with the webpage. Read this blogpost to learn more.

How?

Some JavaScript libraries provide special methods to handle errors. For example: refer to .fail() method discussed here (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR) if you use jQuery's ajax() method. We strongly encourage you to explore ways to handle errors in the library you are using to make API calls.
