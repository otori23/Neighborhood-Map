1) API KEY

- don't necessarily need one
- but good idea to use one, to track your apps stats

2) <script ... async ...>

- don't block DOM construction as script is loaded
- must supply a call back that is invoked when script is loaded 

3) <script ... defer ...>

- don't execute script unitl after page has loaded

4) <div>

- takes width and height of containing elements
- so empty div has width:0 and height:0

5) <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />

- on mobile devices, can zoom in/on maps

6) zoom and center

- map options required on creation

7) Custom Controls

- a control is simply a <div> element which has an absolute position on the map, 
- it displays some UI to the user, ... 
- and handles interaction with either the user or the map, usually through an event handler
